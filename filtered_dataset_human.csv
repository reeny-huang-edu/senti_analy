"16,844 crypto currencies. 80% of them are pure garbage
DISCUSSION
According to Coin Market cap there are 16,844 cryptos out on the world market although Coin Gecko shows 12,463. Still, that's a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail. Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We don't believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they aren't allowed because we are already too many in the room.

Sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and that's their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on. So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can't police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. How can crypto police itself when project tribes can't stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter.

My hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic. People will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so I imagine that number I typed in the title will likely reach 20,000 or 25,0000 by the time 2022 is over.",2
"Haven’t been in a while but the last time I visited r/terraluna it was completely overrun by these detached moonbois. Yet only a few pages further were people contemplating suicide.

Mind boggling",2
"As a developer, yes, it’s good, in large part because of its first mover advantage.

Ethereum has the largest and most active community of developers by a factor of 100, I would estimate. This is a massive advantage for any technology platform. It means there is great documentation, tools, APIs, and resources that make it easy to learn and build with. Got an obscure question about the feature you’re building? There’s probably some help guide, Stack Overflow post or YouTube tutorial to answer it.

And that massive developer community also makes it much easier for startups and businesses to hire engineers who already have experience (and for any new skills, again, they can often just Google the answer).

That’s probably not what you expected to hear. You likely wanted some analysis of TPS or scalability. Ethereum chose the most logical solutions for scalability: a lightweight layer 1 PoS system with sharding and excellent layer 2 options for high transaction throughput. And because they have been focused on that goal longer than any other project, they are by far the most reliable, robust and decentralized smart contract platform available.",1
"Personally, i invest in BTC and ETH.

Reason? Diversification. If the trend of getting everything online and the whole Metaverse thingy continues, then gains will also continue. The rate of adoption is increasing consistently. ETH is a whole new ecosystem with insane amount of applications. Sure, other better crypto could replace it, but so could a better search engine replace Google and yet I'm not too worried about that. BTC is the first real money/property/store of value (whatever you want to call it) which gives you complete control, is decentralised and predictable (you can see the code).",1
