",844 crypto currencies? 80% of them are complete trash\nDISCUSSION\nWith 16,844 cryptos on Coin Market cap (12,463 on Coin Gecko), there's a shitload of worthless projects in the market. It's no wonder some people think crypto is just a penny stock market. Many projects have good intentions but fail, while others simply hang out. Unfortunately, many others are pure scams, and we all know it. This is the price of decentralization, and sometimes I struggle with this. Too many people invest in dumb projects like Squid Game tokens, only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others are rug-pulled. The worst part is the hit we as investors and believers in fundamentals take, giving crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators have a beef with anything about crypto, it's these shady scam projects. But how do we determine a shady scam project until it's officially a scam? Many people in the crypto world say Shib is a scam, and many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say Ethereum is a scam, and so on. So, where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can't police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls, so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. How can crypto police itself when project tribes can't stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on Twitter? My hope",BEARISH,0.976991593837738

Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and that's their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on. So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can't police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. How can crypto police itself when project tribes can't stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter.\n\nMy hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic. People will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so I imagine that number I typed in the title will likely reach 20,000 or 25,000",BEARISH,0.8742855191230774
