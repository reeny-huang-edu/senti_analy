",844 crypto currencies? 80% of them are complete trash\nDISCUSSION\nWith 16,844 cryptos on Coin Market cap (12,463 on Coin Gecko), there's a shitload of worthless projects in the market. It's no wonder some people think crypto is just a penny stock market. Many projects have good intentions but fail, while others simply hang out. Unfortunately, many others are pure scams, and we all know it. This is the price of decentralization, and sometimes I struggle with this. Too many people invest in dumb projects like Squid Game tokens, only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others are rug-pulled. The worst part is the hit we as investors and believers in fundamentals take, giving crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators have a beef with anything about crypto, it's these shady scam projects. But how do we determine a shady scam project until it's officially a scam? Many people in the crypto world say Shib is a scam, and many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say Ethereum is a scam, and so on. So, where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can't police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls, so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. How can crypto police itself when project tribes can't stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on Twitter? My hope",NEUTRAL,0.3808176517486572

",844 crypto currencies. 80% of them are pure garbage\nDISCUSSION\nAccording to Coin Market cap there are 16,844 cryptos out on the world market although Coin Gecko shows 12,463. Still, that's a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail. Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We don't believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they aren't allowed because we are already too many in the room.\n\nSadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image.
